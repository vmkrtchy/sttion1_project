<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Mad Libs is a game with a basic story template that has blank spaces which need to be filled by the user. The fun part is that the user inputs words without knowing the story ahead of time.


Write a program on Python that does the following:

* Allows the user to pick one of the templates
* Asks the user to input words. “Type number”, for example
* Generate a story afterwards and shows it to the user

Don't bother with any additional functions for now, but make sure your program follows these 3 conditions. You will have to use the “random” library, and the only functions you’ll be able to use will be print() and input() or make your own ones. We recommend using one of the three templates provided, which will make the evaluation process easier for your peers.
